# 100 Days of SwiftUI Design Challenge

A 100-day exploration of SwiftUI's capabilities as a design tool, focusing on micro-interactions and visual effects. Each day features a new design challenge to push the boundaries of what's possible with SwiftUI.

## üéØ About This Challenge

I'm taking 100 days to dive back into SwiftUI, but with a designer's perspective. Instead of building full applications, each day I'll create a focused micro-interaction or visual effect to explore SwiftUI's potential for creating engaging user experiences.

The challenge focuses on:
- Micro-interactions
- Animation effects
- UI design

## üé® Daily Practices

### Coming Soon...
Stay tuned for more exciting SwiftUI experiments!
